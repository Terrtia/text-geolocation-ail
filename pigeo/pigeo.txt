Previous research has shown that the geographical bias
in language use can be used in supervised text-
based geolocation models, to learn associations
between textual features and different regions
based on large-scale collections of geotagged doc-
uments/tweets (Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Han
et al., 2012; Maier and G ́omez-Rodrıguez, 2014).

Given an unseen piece of text or the text content
of a user’s timeline, the trained classifier can pre-
dict the most likely location(s) associated with the
input.

Geographical bias in language use is most evident for countries with
different languages (e.g. Germany versus China),
but also exists for countries which share the same
languages (e.g. in the spelling of centre vs. center
in British vs. American English). The linguistic
geographical bias is not limited to these obvious
cases, however, and includes the use of toponyms,
names of people, sport teams, and dialectal terms.

The main idea is to learn the geographical distri-
bution of a given word across different locations
from training data, and use it to predict a location
for a new user
